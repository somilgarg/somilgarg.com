Thoughts on wealth creation by **_James Clear_**
<!--truncate--> 

Real wealth is **not about money**.

Realt wealth is:-
* not having to go to meetings.
* not having to spend time with jerks.
* not being locked into status games.
* not feeling like you have to say **yes** to everything.
* not worry about others claiming your time and energy.

Real wealth is about freedom. 
Money can help achieve this things,but there are plenty of people who make lots of money yet aren't free.
